# Sample Technical Interview Problems

For the Spring semester 2019, I was an Khoury College Fellow for the professional development and co-op prep class (CS1210) for Northeastern's Khoury College of Computer Sciences. Part of this position was helping prepare students for software engineering technical interviews. This repo is a small collection of simple technical interview problems and their solutions.

## Structure

Each problem has its own folder. In that folder, there is a Markdown file with the problem definition. There is then one or more Python files with potential solutions. Python 3 was used for solving the problems.

## Have a new or better solution?

If you have an improvement on a current solution, or a completely new one, feel free to open a PR into this repo with the changes/new approach!

Tweaks to existing solutions should be submitted as changes to that solution file.

New solutions should be submitted as a new .py file under the problem's directory.
