# Sample Technical Interview Problems

For the Spring semester 2019, I was an Khoury College Fellow for the professional development and co-op prep class (CS1210) for Northeastern's Khoury College of Computer Sciences. Part of this position was helping prepare students for software engineering technical interviews. This repo is a small collection of simple technical interview problems and their solutions.

## Structure

Each problem has its own folder. In that folder, there is a Markdown file with the problem definition. There is then one or more Python files with potential solutions. Python 3 was used for solving the problems.
